## [0.10.0] — Unreleased

See the [published changelog](https://apexops.pro/project/changelog/)
for full details on this and all prior releases.

### Security

- Update Astro, sharp, devalue, SVGO, js-yaml, fast-uri and smol-toml to resolve dependency advisories.
  Override markdownlint-cli2's pinned smol-toml dependency with the patched release until its upstream pin is updated.

### Changed (Agent modernization)

- Retire the migrated Astro site and docs-only workflows after verified live acceptance in `apex-docs`.
  Retain runtime guidance and product validation. Export Explorer metadata through explicit output/input paths,
  with the product snapshot under `tools/registry`; documentation builds no longer require a local APEX site.
- Move project governance, IaC checks and consumer maintenance into inactive consumer workflow templates.
  Governance requires explicit opt-in. Workflow updates now preview an allowlisted, commit-pinned change set,
  preserve customizations and report retired files instead of overwriting arbitrary repository workflows.
- Account for exact Bicep `Ignore` resources using preview-bound, hash-checked parent/child observations. Retain
  visible ignored records and block stale evidence, managed actions, missing declared resources and unknown coverage.
- Validate publication Markdown and artifact contracts from an isolated Git-index snapshot, retaining tracked
  template coverage without scanning unrelated untracked projects. Resolve local tools and propagate validator failures.
- Unify current-review lifecycle guidance and replace routine CodeGen per-file stops with bounded validated batches.
- Add read-only input resolution, canonical handoff hashing, structured preview summaries and bounded provider-payload
  regression checks. Reject mismatched preview/policy evidence and keep runtime input approval separate from discovery.
- Permit authenticated public Log Analytics and workspace-based Application Insights endpoints when policy and
  approved requirements allow them. Require AMPLS for private-only monitoring, not as a blanket PaaS default;
  preserve private networking for other data services and cover both IaC tracks with scanner regressions.
- Persist and revalidate explicit Governance/Plan review selections across completion and resume; preserve timestamps
  and destination progress on identical retries, and reject conflicts instead of losing concurrent updates.
- Make `apex-recall show` independent of index mutation and stale primary fallback. Add explicit audited backup
  recovery and report committed-but-index-stale outcomes with the committed primary hash.
- Add immutable review-attempt accounting, optional supporting-input review digests, a guarded canonical handoff
  renderer and read-only owner-draft hash synchronization. These interfaces do not grant workflow approval.
- Add opt-in capability dependency readiness and design-only governance tracing; retain default full-chain gates.
  Provide explicit help for path-based validators and preserve legacy review coverage limitations.
- Bound shared-monitoring discovery conclusions by inspected scope and keep read-only approval separate from redesign.
  Route new pricing through the cost owner and qualify AMPLS capacity, ingestion and budget claims by actual evidence.
  Recheck policy exclusions when adding resource types, verify operator provisioning/login/egress, and distinguish
  conditional design approval from implementation readiness. Correct minimum-IP headroom arithmetic and reuse common pricing.
- Require an approved Azure Monitor client access path before treating disabled public query/ingestion flags as ready.
  Distinguish compilation, platform diagnostics and application telemetry; return missing private connectivity to Planner.
- Avoid Bicep symbols that shadow scope functions; reclassify scaffold diagnostics as module interfaces become available.
  Add an offline compiler regression for resource-group symbol shadowing and dependency-preserving repair.
- Clarify CodeGen exact-path validation and cached-schema evidence; require dependency checks before scaffold deferral.
  Preserve audited confirming reviews and distinguish restored parameter names from verified nested module bindings.
- Correct Bicep guidance for resource-group IDs and explicit dependencies when constructed IDs hide prerequisite edges.
- Preserve canonical compact handoff headings after Plan completion and verify H2 order and length explicitly.
  Editor diagnostics and line-width checks alone do not establish artifact structure compliance.
- Let Step 4 completion explicitly select an authorized comprehensive confirmation while preserving the original review.
  Retain strict validity checks, audit the selection, reject deep-mode substitution, and reuse unchanged human approval.
- Catch scheduled-action scope, display-name, view and schedule omissions in the IaC contract before review.
  Require Planner's complete feasibility check and name bounds without increasing reviewer or auto-fix allowances.
- Validate lowercase Deny coverage and reject explicit planning-validator targets that match no files.
  Stop emitting per-file success for invalid contracts or policy maps.
- Support explicit, audited selection of a later authorized Governance review at completion without overwriting history.
  Preserve strict freshness, artifact/lens/pass checks and separate human approval; never infer the newest review.
  Name the exact pre-approval cache validator and prevent stale recall confirmations from overriding reviewed policy facts.
- Keep bounded Challenger verification separate from artifact editing; return corrections to their owner.
  Trace Governance location claims to policy evidence before review and check freshness independently of formatting.
- Check Governance handoffs for the exact artifact, compact length, pending finding IDs and immediate recovery owner.
  Report structure, review freshness and blocker closure separately instead of blanket validation success.
  Require the checklist read on blocked recovery; verify complete command outcomes and reconcile decision summaries.
- Reject stale, malformed, wrong-target or blocking review evidence before recall completion/transition writes;
  retain audited missing-review skips without allowing them to waive invalid present findings.
- Resolve Governance's revision-cap contradiction and require verified closure before the exact Planner handoff.
  Prioritize Modify operation properties over tag selectors; leave multiple-property mappings unresolved.
- Audit the manual-testing lessons against current code and tests, separating source fixes, native evidence,
  publication and remaining acceptance gaps in the existing remediation ledger.
- Make docs-writer, vendor-prompting and Terraform search/import manual-only; retain explicit documentation adapters,
  required docs updates, vendor validators and state-change approval gates. Production dependency skills remain available.
- Add manual-only `/apex-unslop` prose cleanup, adapted with MIT attribution from Cursor's pstack plugin.
  Preserve technical facts, artifact structure and review boundaries; do not add automatic agent loads.
- Embed local raster icons in generated SVG diagrams instead of container-specific image paths. Require standalone
  SVG icon validation alongside PNG visual checks; preserve the reproducible generator and both output formats.
- Finalize Step 2 content before reviews and keep mutable approval status outside reviewed bytes. Preserve exact-hash
  drift checks on completion/resume and route stale evidence to its owner without restamping prior reviews.
- Standardize interrupted pricing publication recovery and invocation-local request accounting while preserving
  remaining allowances. Pass explicit successful pricing/evidence paths to reviewers, including versioned outputs.
- Permit a pricing-worker-only public Retail Prices API fallback after documented MCP empty results or exhausted
  transient retries. Preserve raw evidence and source labels; enforce request/host limits and existing approval gates.
- Pin JSON-launched Azure MCP to the verified stable release and scope npm's cross-host tarball exception
  to that server process. Add `check:mcp-release` and a weekly/manual freshness check without automatic upgrades.
- Run the same release check automatically at each devcontainer start; warn on outdated or unknown versions
  without blocking container access, installing packages, changing pins or restarting MCP.
- Correct retail pricing discovery for services whose catalog ARM SKU is empty, including Container Registry
  and Key Vault. Reuse service results across tiers and keep meter, usage, region and currency checks explicit.
- Add verified Private Endpoint and private DNS query recipes, global billing-region mappings, zone-month unit
  interpretation and variable-usage inputs. Prevent duplicate billing-zone charges and retain pricing failure gates.
- Exclude infeasible SKU alternatives before pricing and bound Architecture research payloads; a saved checkpoint
  no longer claims to compact the live transcript. Resume expensive phases in a fresh context when needed.
- Isolate Challenger drafts per invocation instead of reusing a shared temporary sibling;
  preserve stale files and reject concatenated JSON before canonical publication.
- Make PaaS data services and App Service APIs private in every environment; retain public HTTPS ingress
  for public-facing web applications. Require private DNS and verified component ownership before relying on DINE.
- Remove non-production public-access execution paths and broad firewall rules from both SQL recipes;
  legacy public-access parameters now accept only `false`.
- Reuse explicit Requirements inputs, reconcile scope dependencies before review, and apply accepted mitigations
  without redundant confirmation. Preserve independent re-review, unresolved blockers and final human approval.
- Add read-only review metadata generation and strict cache verification to the findings validator; count modern
  `runSubagent` spans in the profiler without double-counting linked wrappers. Runtime token savings remain unmeasured.
- Consolidate acceptance lessons in the existing verification procedure: distinguish decisions from execution,
  verify harness provenance and check scope, and stop redundant probes. Add targeted Git troubleshooting
  and representative picker verification guidance without new agents, schemas or mandatory runtime reads.
- Add payload-free probe evidence to the existing debug-log profiler, with optional operator-reviewed text,
  explicit unknown invocation attribution and preserved log provenance; add offline review-gate reload coverage.
- Prevent Challenger self-handoffs after reviewer failure; request human intervention and preserve exhausted
  retry status across handoffs and resumed sessions without fabricating review evidence.
- Clarify preview-only deployment stops: missing backends do not trigger bootstrap or apply approval requests.
  Later setup/deployment requires explicit scope expansion, separate bootstrap authorization and fresh apply approval.
- Clarify both CodeGen recovery contracts: syntax errors, failed validation and plan conflicts do not authorize
  overwriting lines with uncertain ownership; preserve them and obtain clarification before a necessary edit.
- Clarify exact Orchestrator owner names in routing-only answers: Step 1 belongs to `02-Requirements`,
  not an agent inferred from the requirements artifact prefix. A bounded Local routing retest passed.
- Separate explanation-only routing from project setup; honor explicit no-tools requests without waiving
  discovery, reviews or approvals during actual workflow execution.
- Match active model identifiers to the picker: `GPT-5.6 Sol (copilot)`, `GPT-5.6 Terra (copilot)`
  and `GPT-5.6 Luna (copilot)`, including prompt and registry mirrors. Preserve provider suffixes in generated
  assignments and retain family-based validation for space-separated labels.
- Apply the approved MAI, Sol, Terra and Luna agent/worker assignments, retaining unknown Sol metadata as unknown.
- Preserve production roles, reviews and approval gates while making main-agent and leaf-worker invocation boundaries
  explicit and mechanically checked. Restore worker-specific file/text output contracts without nested wrapper fallback.
- Share operational procedures between thin Local prompt adapters and manual Agent Host skill entry points;
  preserve explicit owner/model/tool selection and capture consent. Native harness acceptance remains manual.
- Replace the limited frontmatter parser with structured YAML parsing and align model, vendor-rule and registry checks.
  Distinguish sourced advice from repository conventions; do not infer runtime model eligibility or token savings.
- Retire the E2E agent, launch/analysis prompts, scoring scripts, workflow and exclusive tests/commands.
  Removed commands: `e2e:validate`, `e2e:benchmark`, `e2e:combine`, `test:lib-e2e`.
  Production validation, lessons, recall, historical schemas and existing evidence remain supported.

### Changed (Devcontainer documentation)

- Align setup documentation with build-time tool pins, fail-fast dependency installation,
  preservation of existing MCP configuration, and cache persistence. Image-build and timing validation remain pending.
- Correct GitHub credential forwarding guidance and document user-authorized, per-command identity recovery
  without automatic login, credential switching, or persistent Git configuration changes.

### Changed (Workflow guidance simplification)

- Rename repository skills with exactly one `apex-` prefix and migrate live callers, discovery redirects,
  tooling, documentation and Explorer views. This breaks explicit old-name integrations; no wrappers remain.
  Preserve upstream attribution, public npm aliases, schema bytes and immutable historical evidence.
- Share equivalent deployment safety rules and orphan-resource queries while retaining distinct skill entrypoints.
- Resolve Requirements runbook timing, Design skip prerequisites and deployment-script ownership.
  Preserve compiled ARM evidence and refresh Terraform initialization without transferring plan authority to reviewers.
- Price environment/region/stamp quantities explicitly, reuse only current equivalent evidence, and preserve
  confirmed Azure context without bypassing readiness checks. Correct research routing and instruction inaccuracies.
- Honor read-only context audits, cover leaf workers, fix template-only hook coverage, and avoid duplicate Markdown
  execution where required CI owns it. Preserve Pages build provenance and native aggregate-runner semantics.
- Consolidate native and attachable resume prompts into the Orchestrator's canonical recovery procedure.
  Include native/nested prompts in validation, registry checks, Explorer and context snapshots; preserve unique identities.
- Repair JSONC literal and prototype-key handling, lint failure propagation, ignored-aware link selection,
  and missing-version validation. Retain public npm command aliases and original dependency integrity metadata.
- Run both recall test suites in isolated processes and correct retirement-scanner producer/test ownership.
- Clarify historical root health grades and current workflow/version guidance; retain legal and attribution records.
- Separate APEX handoff-based validation/deployment from generic application preparation plans and validation proof.
  Validation-only and preview-only stop at their requested boundary; missing APEX inputs return to their owner.
- Align Diagnose report paths and Challenger finding types, filenames, field presentation, compact responses,
  and Edit decision serialization with existing contracts. No artifact schema changes.
- Unify CodeGen build checkpoints and partial-scaffold recovery while retaining one-file production cadence.
  A matched AVM-backed batching experiment failed cadence/recovery acceptance and was not adopted.
- Remove duplicate aggregate handoff validation and repair the pre-commit serialization test.
- Consolidate same-scope site instructions, preserving template/styling rules and separate source-change triggers.
  Correct Starlight title ownership in instructions, review prompts, and docs-writer references.
- Use one combined CodeGen validation worker and policy-first tag checks; preserve required reviews and security gates.
- Remove repeated artifact validation within E2E checks without changing diagnostic scoring weights or public aliases.
- Keep handoffs path-based and As-Built reads scoped to requested outputs; preserve full-suite completion requirements.
- Make unattended reviews fail closed on unresolved blockers, including benchmark runs, following explicit user approval.
- Validate existing review-cache inputs rather than treating a newly updated discovery signature as review evidence.
- Correct Terraform test CLI examples, externally managed drift exceptions, and Entra-authenticated Storage examples.
- Remove latency-to-token inference and unsupported rewrite-cost multipliers; use editing tools for existing artifacts.
- Reject unknown validation suites and missing policy-envelope evidence; preserve valid informational policy drift.
- Keep the Terraform azd path behind the existing preview, approval, and live-policy gates.
  Classify Bicep what-if `Deploy` as unknown changes rather than a no-op.
- Consolidate workflow routing instructions around the shared IaC planner and declared refinement returns.
  Resume guidance now uses per-step state and track decisions instead of numeric step arithmetic.
- Reconcile Orchestrator review and handoff rules: keep Plan and separate cost review mandatory,
  reuse current specialist reviews, preserve accepted-gate session breaks, and require evidence when recovering progress.
- Make shared prerequisite reads phase-specific and cached reads freshness-aware. Clarify that authoring globs
  do not prove runtime attachment; preserve critical agent-body safeguards and canonical root ownership.
- Keep local verification proportional to risk; live Azure testing is no longer a prerequisite for guidance-only fixes.
- Align the Architect's gate reference with mandatory cost review and reviews-before-completion ordering.
  Reuse the canonical batched finding panel while preserving separate decisions and rationales.
- Check Planner and CodeGen prerequisites before bulk skill reads, defer phase-specific Planner references,
  and use the SKU manifest instead of repeatedly reconstructing selections from architecture prose.
- Remove unrelated explicit notebook tools from workflow agents and code-refactoring tools from non-code roles.
  Preserve discovery groups and role-relevant execution, diagnostics, and IaC refactoring capabilities.
- Replace retired Terraform MCP calls with Registry API and provider-schema workflows;
  CodeGen preserves approved exact pins.
- Recover recorded Requirements answers on resume instead of forcing a fresh questionnaire, retaining required elicitation.
- Permit required deferred guidance after compaction and verify current deployment/inventory evidence on As-Built resume.
- Recognize deep Plan review sidecars in runtime and CI presence checks, with atomic failure tests.
- Align shared CodeGen and contract-handoff references with supported module discovery,
  approved exact pins, and required guidance recovery after compaction.
- Align Planner finding questions with the canonical four-choice approval panel and individual notes.
- Reject expired or invalid governance discovery cache metadata and force live refresh for TTL expiry or signature drift.
  Add mocked expiry regressions and reconcile the agent's cache-first instructions.
- Clarify exact missing-prerequisite handoff targets and governance ownership based on isolated custom-agent probes.
  Budget-only Requirements refinement preserves existing SKU-manifest fields and pins.

### Fixed (Workflow optimization prerequisites)

- Fix context snapshot and diff repository roots, include Copilot, model,
  registry, and IaC folder inputs, and verify captured content hashes.
  Missing required inputs and altered snapshots now fail instead of producing
  misleading baseline comparisons. New captures include source revision and working-tree provenance.
- Preserve unknown telemetry rather than averaging it as zero. Baseline
  measurement now covers all recorded phases and reports per-metric sample sizes.
- Propagate Terraform initialization and validation failures across projects.
- Require the existing separate cost-estimate review at Step 2 completion
  and in the CI presence fallback, including explicit deep-review sessions.
  Historical records are unchanged on refusal; resumed sessions must supply missing evidence.
- Align CodeGen handoffs with their pre-completion validation duties and stop
  E2E runs after exhausted governance retries. Approval and artifact schemas remain unchanged.
- Exclude nested generated pytest caches from Markdown lint so package-local test runs do not break the repository gate.
- Classify overlapping reads using trace, range, request, timing, and result evidence instead of filenames alone.
  Incomplete evidence remains advisory; duplicate exported spans no longer inflate read or token totals.
- Report missing OTel token usage explicitly and compute averages only over observed values.

### Changed (MCP consolidation)

- feat(audit): add a read-only whole-repository retirement scanner that classifies every baseline-tracked file,
  records reachability, ownership, history, duplication, and protected runtime entrypoints, and requires explicit
  human approval before archival. The initial scan consolidated approved duplicate authentication, identity, Key Vault,
  and global-rule references under canonical skill owners and archived the superseded copies with checksums.
- refactor(tests): consolidate active tooling and fixture coverage under
  `tools/tests/`, remove obsolete root trigger shims and fixtures, and run the
  migrated Node, Python, and SKU contract suites in CI. Deterministic archives
  retain the retired root-test content and superseded guidance with checksums.
- refactor(mcp): replace the in-repo Azure Pricing MCP server with Microsoft's
  hosted Azure Resource Manager MCP server. Cost estimation now uses the
  read-only retail pricing and Cost Management tools without compatibility
  wrappers for removed custom features.
- refactor(diagrams): retire the Draw.io MCP server and active Draw.io authoring
  stack. New architecture diagrams use reproducible Python source with PNG and
  SVG renders; the complete historical Draw.io skill is archived alongside the
  compressed visual-source bundle.
- refactor(iac): make the Azure Defaults cost-monitoring baseline the sole owner
  of budget notifications, Action Group routing, anomaly detection, and
  governance precedence; consumers now reference that contract without copying
  threshold tables.
- refactor(docs): retire the unused Astro docs MCP registration. Astro/Starlight
  site builds, validation, and the local documentation review prompt remain.
- refactor(terraform): retire Terraform MCP and its Go-only runtime. Terraform
  workflows now use Azure MCP for Azure guidance and discovery, the public
  Terraform Registry API for metadata, and Terraform CLI for provider schemas.
- refactor(devcontainer): replace the Azure Tools extension pack with standalone
  Azure MCP, remove optional and Markdown-specific editor extensions, pin direct
  Python tooling, retire unused Checkov and TFLint installs, and move dependency
  installation to container creation only.

### Security

- fix(deps): pin patched transitive releases for `undici`, `nanoid`, and
  `brace-expansion`, resolving the open Dependabot advisories and producing
  zero findings from both root and site npm audits.

### Added (Agent authoring skill)

- feat(skills): add an on-demand `agent-authoring` workflow skill for creating,
  restructuring, and auditing Copilot agents and prompts. Detailed model policy,
  runtime guardrails, decision logging, and authoring workflows now load only
  when agent-development work requires them.

### Changed (Agent instruction context reduction)

- perf(instructions): reduce the universally applied
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md` from an extended authoring guide to a thin
  enforcement layer. Runtime contracts and stable anchors remain auto-loaded;
  rationale, examples, and procedural guidance moved to the `agent-authoring`
  skill and its progressive references.

### Changed (Cache-aware validation)

- perf(scripts): replace the unbounded Node validator `run-p` fan-out with a
  cache-aware runner. Node validators now share workspace/frontmatter, workflow
  graph, registry JSON, artifact, and compiled-schema caches in one process;
  Python, ESLint, and `node --test` commands run through a bounded child pool.
  Legacy aggregates remain available for rollback and benchmarking.

### Changed (Canonical Azure defaults)

- perf(skills): remove duplicated region, tag, and security tables from
  `azure-defaults`. The skill now provides only IaC sequencing, unique
  invariants, and a progressive reference index; `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  remains the sole canonical owner of default values.
- test(scripts): replace region-table mirror comparison with ownership
  validation that requires the canonical link and rejects duplicated defaults
  in the skill.

### Changed (Repository deduplication and runtime efficiency)

- perf(site): remove five byte-identical `site/src/assets/images/hero-*.jpg`
  copies; documentation continues to use the canonical public images.
- perf(governance): store the tracked governance baseline as deterministic gzip
  and add shared Python/Node loaders plus schema validation. The artifact shrinks
  from 8.69 MB to 354 KB without changing its JSON semantics.
- refactor(scripts): consolidate H2 extraction, frontmatter parsing, skill
  reference discovery, and common AVM path matching into shared helpers with
  regression tests.
- perf(site): preserve the explorer `generatedAt` timestamp when semantic graph
  content is unchanged, producing byte-identical output on repeated generation.
- perf(pricing-mcp): coalesce concurrent retirement-data cache misses through a
  cancellation-safe shared task so parallel callers perform one upstream fetch.
- fix(devcontainer): install system `pytest` and Azure Pricing `[admin,dev]`
  extras during create/start/update so the full external validation suite is
  available after container rebuilds and tool refreshes.

### Changed (Model migration — 2026-07 successors)

- chore(agents): replaced active `Claude Opus 4.8` assignments with
  `Claude Opus 5` for architecture and IaC planning.
- chore(agents): replaced active `GPT-5.3-Codex` assignments with
  `GPT-5.6-Luna` for governance, deployment, challenger, and cost estimation.
- chore(agents): replaced active `GPT-5.5` assignments with
  `GPT-5.6-Terra` for diagnostics, E2E orchestration, and challenger review.
- chore(models): retained the superseded catalog entries as deprecated audit
  history, added distinct Luna and Terra validator families, and preserved
  reviewer-only Luna and outcome-first Terra prompting behavior.

### Changed (Model migration — Claude Sonnet 4.6 → Claude Sonnet 5)

- chore(agents): migrated all 11 agents/subagents in the Sonnet cohort
  from `Claude Sonnet 4.6` to `Claude Sonnet 5` (API model id
  `claude-sonnet-5`) — `02-Requirements`, `04-Design`,
  `06b-Bicep CodeGen`, `06t-Terraform CodeGen`, `08-As-Built`,
  `11-Context Optimizer`, and the five IaC validate/whatif/plan/precheck
  subagents (`bicep-validate-subagent`, `bicep-whatif-subagent`,
  `terraform-validate-subagent`, `terraform-plan-subagent`,
  `policy-precheck-subagent`). `Claude Sonnet 4.6` is now
  `deprecated: true` in `model-catalog.json`, retained for audit
  history only. CodeGen agents stay pinned to `effort: high` (no
  `xhigh` escalation — AVM generation is structured execution, not
  deep reasoning).
- docs(vendor-prompting): `claude-best-practices.md` gains rule
  R-CL-10 covering Sonnet 5 migration deltas (adaptive thinking on by
  default, manual extended thinking removed, new tokenizer ~30% more
  tokens, more literal instruction following, review-harness coverage
  guidance), citing the new
  [prompting-claude-sonnet-5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-sonnet-5)
  source. `rules.json`, `family-support.md`, and `SKILL.md` source
  citations updated; `fetch-vendor-prompting-guides.mjs` now tracks the
  new source for drift detection.
- docs: updated all cross-references in
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md`, `agent-operating-frame.instructions.md`,
  `context-optimization.instructions.md`, `context-management` skill
  token budgets, `workflow-engine` handoff guide, `docs-writer`
  repo-architecture reference, the docs site (`agents.md`,
  `architecture-explorer-graph.json`), and `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`.

### Removed (tools/scripts dead-code cleanup)

- chore(scripts): delete orphaned/one-time scripts with no npm, hook, or
  CI wiring — `report-agent-body-sizes.mjs` (superseded by
  `assess-agents.mjs`), `migrate-legacy-findings.mjs` (one-time v1.0
  findings migration), `bench-hooks.sh`, `crawl-dev-site.mjs`,
  `strip-handoff-kind.py`, and the eight `markdown-prettifiers/*.py`
  one-time doc-styling tools. Companion cleanup drops the
  `markdown-prettifiers/**` ignore glob from `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`
  and the stale migration reference in `validate-challenger-findings.mjs`.

### Added (Workflow hardening — issue #425)

- feat(skills): `azure-artifacts` SKILL.md gains a `## Post-write
  validation` table (JSON → `python -m json.tool`, Bicep →
  `bicep build --stdout`, Terraform → `terraform fmt -check` +
  `terraform validate`; Markdown delegated to the lefthook
  `artifact-validation` hook). The shared agent operating-frame
  instructions reference it so every Step 1–7 agent inherits the rule.
  Guarded by `tools/tests/scripts/test_post_write_validation.mjs`.
- feat(scripts): `safe-shell.mjs` linter gains two new rules.
  `command-portability` flags bare `rg` / `fd` / `bat` invocations in
  committed shell snippets unless a `command -v <tool>` guard appears
  in the same fence. `agent-output-no-heredoc` flags heredoc, `tee`,
  `>`, and `>>` writes targeting `agent-output/**`. Fixture-driven
  tests in `tools/tests/scripts/test_safe_shell.mjs` cover guarded,
  unguarded, append-redirect, tee, and indented-heredoc cases.
- feat(instructions): `no-interactive-shell.instructions.md` gains
  Rule 4 (Command portability). `no-heredoc.instructions.md` gains
  the no-shell-writes-to-`agent-output/**` sub-rule.
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md` gains rules for the new
  no-shell-writes-to-agent-output and execution-subagent invocation
  prompt contracts.
- feat(agents): canonical execution-subagent invocation prompt
  template at
  `tools/apex-prompts/utility-prompts/execution-subagent.prompt.md`
  with three required H2s (`## Objective`, `## Commands`,
  `## Expected return`). Parent agents must follow this shape when
  calling `runSubagent` for validate / what-if / plan /
  policy-precheck / cost-estimate / challenger-review subagents.
- feat(schemas): `deployment-preview-v1` JSON schema at
  `tools/schemas/deployment-preview.schema.json` defines the
  five-line deploy approval block composed by 07b/07t from
  what-if / plan / policy-precheck / cost-estimate JSON.
- feat(apex-recall): new `transition` subcommand bundles
  `complete-step` (with challenger-findings gate) + N×`decide` +
  next-step `start-step` into a single atomic
  `00-session-state.json` write. Preferred path for step changes;
  legacy commands remain. Exit 2 when the challenger sidecar is
  missing (same semantics as `complete-step`). Six tests in
  `tools/apex-recall/tests/test_transition.py`.
- feat(agents): `07b-bicep-deploy` and `07t-terraform-deploy` add a
  `## Deploy Approval Block` step that renders a five-line gate
  (creates/modifies/deletes, destructive, deploy_gate, cost_delta vs
  envelope, decision) before `azd up` / `terraform apply`. Composed
  preview is persisted to
  `agent-output/{project}/06-deploy-approval.json` conforming to
  `deployment-preview-v1`.
- feat(skills): `iac-common` gains `## Bounded retry` (3-attempt cap;
  escalates with `proceed-with-substitute` / `change-region` /
  `abort`). Referenced from 07b, 07t, 04g-governance. New
  challenger-checklist entries flag missing approval blocks and
  unbounded retry loops.

### Changed (Workflow hardening — issue #425)

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` advertises
  `apex-recall transition` as the preferred call for step changes.

### Changed (tools/scripts validator wiring)

- chore(scripts): wire `validate-context-budget.mjs` into `validate:_node`
  and `validate:_node-ci` (new `validate:context-budget` alias) so the
  documented Per-Step File Re-Read Budget (HARD LIMIT) is enforced in CI
  instead of sitting unwired. The validator itself runs as part of
  `validate:_node` / `validate:_node-ci`. A standalone smoke test
  (`tools/tests/validate-context-budget.test.mjs`, runnable via
  `test:context-budget`) guards the alias wiring and validator health in
  local development.

### Rollback (Workflow hardening — issue #425)

The change is additive. Rollback paths:

- `apex-recall transition` — legacy `checkpoint` / `decide` /
  `complete-step` commands remain functional; orchestrators can
  revert to them.
- Deploy approval block — the H2 in 07b/07t can be reverted by a
  one-line agent edit; existing what-if + policy-precheck flow is
  preserved.
- safe-shell rules — additive; no behavior change for compliant
  snippets. Disable individual rules by removing them from `RULES`
  in `tools/scripts/safe-shell.mjs`.

### Changed (tools/scripts DRY — _lib/json)

- refactor(scripts): extract `readJson` / `readJsonSafe` / `writeJson` /
  `sha256File` into `tools/scripts/_lib/json.mjs` and adopt it across 11
  validators/generators (IaC contract + handoff + consistency, policy
  property map, environment manifest, SKU manifest + IaC coverage, SKU
  allowlist derivation, Draw.io baseline capture, Azure-icon freshness,
  explorer-graph generation). Removes the inline `JSON.parse(readFileSync)`
  duplication and the now-orphaned `fs` / `crypto` imports; behavior is
  byte-for-byte identical. Guarded by `tools/tests/lib/json.test.mjs`
  (`test:lib-json`).

### Changed (tools/scripts DRY — _lib/ajv-validator)

- refactor(scripts): extract the `new Ajv2020({ allErrors: true, strict:
  false })` + `addFormats` construction and the read-schema-then-compile
  `loadValidator` into `tools/scripts/_lib/ajv-validator.mjs`
  (`createAjv`, `loadValidator`). Adopt it across 8 validators (IaC
  contract + handoff, policy property map, environment manifest, SKU
  manifest, challenge-findings decisions, JSON-schema validator, artifact
  governance-schema check), removing the duplicated Ajv boilerplate and
  now-orphaned `ajv` / `ajv-formats` imports; behavior is identical.
  `validate-decision-keys.mjs` is intentionally left untouched (it omits
  `addFormats` by design). Guarded by
  `tools/tests/lib/ajv-validator.test.mjs` (`test:lib-ajv`).

### Changed (tools/scripts DRY — _lib/e2e-helpers)

- refactor(scripts): extract the duplicated `detectIacTool` and
  `fileExists` helpers (byte-identical across `benchmark-e2e.mjs` and
  `validate-e2e-step.mjs`) into `tools/scripts/_lib/e2e-helpers.mjs`, and
  point the e2e family's inline JSON readers at the existing
  `_lib/json.mjs` helpers (`readJsonSafe` for the null-on-error variant in
  `benchmark-e2e` + `combine-e2e-runs`; strict `readJson` in
  `measure-workflow-baseline`). `validate-e2e-step`'s JSON output contract
  is unchanged. Guarded by `tools/tests/lib/e2e-helpers.test.mjs`
  (`test:lib-e2e`).

### Changed (tools/scripts consolidation — validate-models)

- refactor(scripts): merge the three read-only model validators
  (`validate-model-catalog`, `validate-model-consistency`,
  `validate-deprecated-models`) into a single
  `tools/scripts/validate-models.mjs` with `--only=catalog|consistency|deprecated`
  (no flag runs all three). The `validate:model-catalog`,
  `validate:model-consistency`, and `validate:deprecated-models` npm
  aliases are preserved as thin pass-throughs, so hooks/CI are unchanged;
  a new `validate:models` runs the full set. Per-mode output is
  byte-for-byte identical to the former scripts (verified by diff against
  a `main` worktree). The mutating generator (`generate-model-catalog.mjs`)
  stays separate, and its `buildAssignments` helper moves into
  `_lib/model-helpers.mjs` — removing the former validator→generator
  import. All live in-repo references to the three former script paths
  (code comments, the agent-registry schema description, model-catalog.json
  metadata, vendor-prompting instructions + skill references, and the
  regenerated architecture-explorer-graph.json) are repointed to
  `validate-models.mjs`; historical CHANGELOG / QUALITY_SCORE entries are
  left intact. Guarded by `tools/tests/validate-models.test.mjs`
  (`test:models`).

### Added (docs)

- docs(concepts): add `concepts/workflow-deep-dive` — long-form
  integration view of a single APEX run covering the five context
  surfaces (skills, instructions, `.github/data/` registries,
  `apex-recall`, hooks), a per-stage sub-template walkthrough for
  Steps 1 → 7 + Post-Lessons, and the lessons-feedback loop. Ships with
  a regenerable Python-diagrams source at
  `site/src/assets/diagrams/workflow-deep-dive/gen.py` plus the
  end-to-end orchestration and lessons-loop PNGs. Sidebar entry added
  under _Concepts_ as a sibling to _How It Works_.

### Added (Plan 01 — token-reduction workstream)

- `tools/scripts/profile_debug_log.py` + `npm run profile:debug-log` —
  OTel debug-log profiler extracting token totals, per-model splits,
  askQuestions count + duration, subagent wall-time, duplicate
  file-read map, tool-payload sizes, error counts, and compliance
  warnings. Reference: `.github/skills/context-management/references/log-profiling.md`.
- `agent-output/_baselines/multi-log-baseline.json` — multi-log
  baseline (5 OTel sessions, p50/p90/max) used by Plan 01 Phase 5
  targets. `.gitignore` updated to allow this single deliverable
  through while keeping ephemeral snapshots ignored.
- `tools/scripts/validate_orchestrator_handoff.py` +
  `npm run validate:orchestrator-handoff` — Gate-boundary `/clear`
  handoff contract lint (Plan 01 Phase 2a). Hard fail when the
  verbatim resume line, the `apex-recall checkpoint` precondition, or
  the resume-path first tool call is removed or paraphrased.
- `tools/scripts/validate_review_ceiling.py` +
  `npm run validate:review-ceiling` — dual-mode validator: contract
  lint (default-depth ceiling = 2, deep-depth ceiling = 4 challenger
  passes per step) and budget mode (`--budget LOGFILE`) that counts
  per-step invocations in an OTel log.
- `tools/scripts/validate_question_batching.py` +
  `npm run validate:question-batching` — Plan 01 Phase 4 P0 directive
  plus 6-question example lint for `02-requirements.agent.md`.
- `tools/tests/integration/smoke-run.md` — Plan 01 acceptance harness
  (manual Steps 1 → 2 with `/clear` boundaries, captures askQuestions
  count, challenger invocations, inter-`/clear` chat-span max,
  post-`/clear` first input tokens).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-chat-feedback.md` — upstream issue
  template for Copilot Chat behaviour outside any agent's reach
  (e.g. the parallel-retry race documented in
  `docs/devcontainer-hygiene.md`).

### Changed (Plan 01 — token-reduction workstream)

- **Gate-boundary `/clear` handoff** is now mandatory at every
  accepted Gate (1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5) in `01-orchestrator.agent.md`.
  The orchestrator must run `apex-recall checkpoint` first, present
  the gate, then end the message with a verbatim resume line. The
  full contract lives in
  `.github/skills/context-management/references/compression-templates.md`.
- **Challenger-invocation ceiling**: per-step cap of 2 passes
  (`default` depth) or 4 passes (`deep` depth) with explicit
  Accept / Override / Abort `askQuestions` recovery when exceeded.
  New keys `challenger_invocations_<step>`, `challenger_override_<step>`,
  `challenger_decision_<step>` registered in
  `tools/apex-recall/docs/decision-keys.md`.
- **Filesystem precheck**: `.github/instructions/azure-artifacts.instructions.md`
  now scopes the "edit, don't `create_file`" rule explicitly to the
  three high-frequency artifacts (`sku-manifest.json`, `00-handoff.md`,
  `README.md`). General rule unchanged.
- **`.digest.md` reconciliation**: deleted the stale
  `orchestrator-handoff-guide.digest.md` reference in
  `01-orchestrator.agent.md` (digest tier was retired in
  commit `24a35809`). Decision captured in
  `/memories/repo/codegen-model-mix-2026.md`.
- **Orchestrator init**: `Starting a New Project` step 4 now
  explicitly says `create_directory` (not a `create_file`
  placeholder) for `agent-output/{project}/`.
- **02-Requirements**: P0 directive subsection at top of Phase 1
  with explicit 6-question numbered example for `askQuestions`
  batching. Target: askQuestions count ≤ 10 per Step 1.
- **Model mix swaps** (5 immediate, 1 A/B-gated):
  - 05-iac-planner: Claude Opus 4.7 → Claude Sonnet 4.6
  - 04g-governance, 07b-bicep-deploy, 07t-terraform-deploy, 10-challenger (wrapper):
    GPT-5.5 → GPT-5.3-Codex
  - 11-context-optimizer: Claude Opus 4.7 → Claude Sonnet 4.6
  - `challenger-review-subagent` (subagent): GPT-5.5 → Sonnet 4.6
    is **A/B-gated** on the `test/challenger-sonnet` branch — not
    merged. Rollback path + quality rubric in
    `/memories/repo/codegen-model-mix-2026.md`.
- **PR template**: added a "Token / latency impact" section so
  PR authors confirm whether the change moves the input-token or
  per-turn-latency budget.

### Changed (other)

- refactor(agents)!: migrate `06b-Bicep CodeGen` and `06t-Terraform CodeGen`
  from `GPT-5.5` to `Claude Sonnet 4.6`. Frontmatter `model:` flipped,
  `tools/registry/agent-registry.json` mirrored, `.github/model-catalog.json`
  regenerated (Sonnet 4.6 `use_for` adds `iac-codegen`; GPT-5.5 drops it).
  Bodies kept structurally GPT-5.5 outcome-first — only minimal change is the
  existing `## Output Contract` heading converted to an `<output_contract>`
  XML block to satisfy the Anthropic `claude-output-contract-001` rule.
  All verbatim invariants (security baseline, AVM-first contract, Phase 1.5
  HARD GATE language, `apex-recall` calls, subagent JSON consumption shape,
  Do/Don't entries) preserved byte-exact. Rationale: family alignment with the
  Sonnet validate/whatif/plan subagents these agents already dispatch, plus
  stronger verbatim invariant retention under XML-tagged contracts. Does not
  re-trigger QUALITY_SCORE 2026-05-12 (no `<context_awareness>` block added).
- feat(agents): migrate `09-Diagnose` to `GPT-5.5` and convert
  `diagnose-resource.prompt.md` to the outcome-first GPT-5.5 skeleton while
  preserving approval-first Azure diagnostics and report output.
- refactor(agents)!: simplify challenger reviews — default flow is now
  **single-pass `comprehensive`** at every mandatory step (1, 2, 4); Step 3.5
  runs `governance-reconciliation`; multi-pass rotating-lens review is
  **opt-in only** (`decisions.review_depth = "deep"` or explicit
  `10-Challenger` invocation). Tier-driven auto-fire is removed.
  **Breaking schema changes** (no alias, no deprecation window — single
  monorepo, no external consumers):
  - Rename per-step `complexity_matrix` → `opt_in_matrix` in
    `workflow-graph.json` (4 occurrences: step-2, step-4, step-5b, step-5t),
    `tools/schemas/workflow-graph.schema.json` (dropped the `required:
["simple","standard","complex"]` array under the matrix to reflect opt-in
    semantics — partial tier subsets are now allowed),
    `tools/scripts/validate-workflow-graph.mjs` (`validateChallenger()`),
    `.github/skills/workflow-engine/references/orchestrator-handoff-guide.md`,
    `orchestrator-handoff-guide.digest.md`,
    `tools/tests/subagent-file-contract.test.mjs`,
    `tools/tests/fixtures/subagent-file-contract/challenger-review.findings.json`,
    `tools/tests/bats/subagent-validation.bats`.
  - Step 4 default lens: `security-governance` → `comprehensive`.
  - New `governance-reconciliation` lens (added to `VALID_LENSES` and
    `challenger-review-subagent` `review_focus` enum).
  - New return_edges in `workflow-graph.json`: `step-4 → step-2` on
    `on_architecture_must_fix` and `step-3_5 → step-2` on
    `on_must_fix_governance_conflict` (closes gate-3 livelock when a
    finding carries `requires_step == "step-2"`; reconciliation never
    self-edits the approved architecture).
  - New challenger findings JSON shape (`schema_version: "1.0"`): adds
    `traces_to: string[]`, `suggested_fix: { artifact_path, line_range?,
proposed_edit }`, `requires_step: string`, and a `cache_inputs` block
    holding individual `artifact_sha`, `checklists_sha`, `protocol_sha`,
    `subagent_sha`, `model` plus the combined `artifact_hash`. Validated by
    new `tools/scripts/validate-challenger-findings.mjs`
    (`npm run validate:challenger-findings`).
  - Legacy `agent-output/nordic-foods/challenge-findings-*.json` (9 files)
    migrated once via `tools/scripts/migrate-legacy-findings.mjs`
    (`issues→findings`, `title→claim`, `description→evidence`,
    `failure_scenario→impact`, `suggested_mitigation→suggested_fix.proposed_edit`).
    The dangling `$schema` pointer is removed by the migration.
  - `.github/skills/azure-defaults/references/challenger-selection-rules.md`
    deleted (folded into `adversarial-review-protocol.md → ## Opt-in: Deep
adversarial review`). Inbound refs repointed in 06b/06t CodeGen agents,
    `iac-common/references/codegen-shared-workflow.md`, and the site doc.
  - New `decisions.review_depth ∈ {"default", "deep"}`, captured **once**
    per project by `01-Orchestrator` only (02-Requirements reads but never
    writes). Validated by `tools/scripts/validate-session-state.mjs`.
  - New artifact-hash findings cache: parent agents reuse prior findings
    when ALL of `artifact_sha`, `checklists_sha`, `protocol_sha`,
    `subagent_sha`, and `model` match the cached `cache_inputs`.
  - New scripts: `tools/scripts/lessons-to-checklists.mjs`
    (`npm run report:challenger-gaps`),
    `tools/scripts/challenger-telemetry.mjs`
    (`npm run challenger-telemetry`),
    `tools/scripts/validate-lens-references.mjs`
    (`npm run validate:lens-references`, wired into `validate:all`).
  - `10-Challenger` wrapper now defaults to `comprehensive`; multi-pass
    and batch mode is the explicit opt-in entry point. Retirement-review
    trigger documented (≥ 20 invocations OR 30 days post-merge).
- chore(catalog): drop the `(High reasoning)` suffix from the Opus 4.7 label.
  `Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning)` and `Claude Opus 4.7` were two distinct
  catalog entries pointing at the same SKU. Reasoning-effort policy is now a
  per-agent decision documented in
  `.github/instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md` (see the
  "Reasoning-effort policy" subsection), not encoded in the model label.
  Updates: 4 agent frontmatters (Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner,
  Context Optimizer), 4 prompt frontmatters, 5 registry rows, model catalog
  (entries merged + assignments regenerated), vendor-prompting rules and
  fixtures, classify-model test, and supporting docs. Historical changelog
  entries left intact (audit-trail integrity).

### Added

- feat(agents): migrate the three remaining GPT-5.4 main agents
  (`07b-bicep-deploy`, `07t-terraform-deploy`, `08-as-built`) to `GPT-5.5`
  with outcome-first body rewrites (`Role` / `# Goal` / `# Success criteria`
  / `# Constraints` / `# Output` / `# Stop rules`). `08-as-built` gains a
  `## Subagent Budget` H2 for symmetry with the deploy agents. `GPT-5.4`
  flipped to `deprecated: true` in `.github/model-catalog.json` with zero
  remaining active assignments — the GPT-5.4 cohort is fully retired.
  `GPT-5.5` `use_for` adds `deployment-execution` and
  `as-built-documentation`. The cross-family gap between
  `as-built-from-azure.prompt.md` (GPT-5.5) and its target `08-As-Built`
  agent is closed (both same-family). The orphan
  `review-imported-iac.prompt.md` (previously GPT-5.4) is also migrated to
  `GPT-5.5`. `lint-model-alignment.mjs` gains a `gpt-5.5` classifier branch
  (pre-existing blind spot — every existing GPT-5.5 agent previously
  classified as `unknown`). `.github/skills/vendor-prompting/rules.json`
  cleaned of retired GPT-5.4 family registry entry,
  `gpt55-skeleton-001.family_overrides`, and
  `gpt-no-claude-xml-001`/`personality-scoping-001` `model_families` arrays.
  `e2e-orchestrator` (was Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning), now `GPT-5.5`)
  also rewritten in the GPT-5.5 outcome-first style. Catalog gains a new
  `Claude Opus 4.7` (no reasoning suffix) entry used by `09-Diagnose`.
- feat(agents): migrate the Orchestrator (was Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning))
  and the Sonnet 4.6 cohort (Orchestrator Fast Path, Design, Governance,
  Bicep CodeGen, Terraform CodeGen, Challenger, challenger-review-subagent)
  to `GPT-5.5`. Eight agents + one subagent receive full GPT-5.5 prompt
  rewrites following the OpenAI prompting guide skeleton (Role / Personality
  / Goal / Success / Constraints / Output / Stop), layered around the
  existing required sections (output_contract, security baseline, workflow
  contracts) which stay verbatim. Four prompt files swap accordingly
  (`01-orchestrator.prompt.md`, `resume-workflow.prompt.md`,
  `04-design.prompt.md`, `as-built-from-azure.prompt.md` — the last
  intentionally GPT-5.5 even though it invokes the GPT-5.4 08-As-Built
  agent, to keep the prompt-author UX consistent across the migrated
  cohort). Eight registry rows updated. Orchestrator self-reference body
  table corrected (high-row 'Code Gen' attribution fixed; low-row tier
  retired in favor of a footnote pointing at the registry). The six
  Opus 4.7 agents (Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner, Diagnose, Context
  Optimizer, E2E Orchestrator) and the GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.3-Codex agents and
  subagents are unchanged.
- chore(catalog): redesign `.github/model-catalog.json` as model metadata
  (`models`, hand-maintained label allow-list) plus auto-generated
  `assignments` (mirrored from frontmatter). Adds `governance` block
  documenting the source-of-truth chain. Replaces the retired `floors`
  block. Adds `GPT-5.5` (tier `balanced`) and marks `Claude Sonnet 4.6`
  `deprecated: true`.
- feat(tools): add `generate-model-catalog.mjs` (rebuilds `assignments`
  from frontmatter; `--check` mode for CI drift detection) and
  `validate-model-catalog.mjs` (enforces label allow-list, assignments
  match generator output, deprecated models absent from active
  assignments). Wired into `validate:_node` / `validate:_node-ci`. Adds a
  lefthook pre-commit hook that auto-regenerates `assignments` whenever an
  agent frontmatter file is staged.
- feat(agents): migrate Opus-tier agents from `Claude Opus 4.6` to
  `Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning)`. Updates 7 agent frontmatters
  (Orchestrator, Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner, Diagnose,
  Context Optimizer, E2E Orchestrator), 4 prompt frontmatters
  (`01-orchestrator.prompt.md`, `resume-workflow.prompt.md`,
  `doc-gardening.prompt.md`, `tools/tests/prompts/e2e-analyze-lessons.prompt.md`),
  the 7 corresponding rows in `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`, and the
  Orchestrator self-reference body table. The `Claude Opus 4.6` catalog entry
  is retained with `deprecated: true` for audit history. Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5
  are unchanged.
- feat(tools): replace `validate-model-floors.mjs` + the `KNOWN_MODELS`
  allow-list in `validate-agent-registry.mjs` with a single
  `validate-model-consistency.mjs` check. The agent's YAML frontmatter
  `model` field is now the single source of truth; the registry mirrors it
  and the catalog is documentation only (not enforced). Adds
  `validate:model-consistency` to `validate:_node` and `validate:_node-ci`;
  removes `lint:model-floors`.
- feat(agents): retire workspace-wide `<!-- Recommended reasoning_effort: ... -->`
  HTML annotation. Removed from 15 agent files (Orchestrator, Requirements,
  Architect, Design, Governance, IaC Planner, Bicep CodeGen, Terraform CodeGen,
  As-Built, Diagnose, Challenger, Context Optimizer, E2E Orchestrator,
  Orchestrator Fast Path, challenger-review-subagent) and from
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md`. `validate-agents.mjs` and
  `lint-model-alignment.mjs` Check 3 (reasoning_effort presence) deleted;
  remaining checks renumbered 4 → 3 (large-agent context_awareness) and
  5 → 4 (investigate_before_answering).

### Changed

- chore(audit): Phase 5 of the Opus 4.7 migration audited the 7 Opus agents
  end-to-end against Anthropic's published 4.7 behavioral changes. Strengthened
  the Orchestrator's gate-1 challenger pass language (now declared "**Mandatory:**…
  not optional and must not be skipped") and rewrote `## Resuming a Project`
  to require a 3-signal absence (no apex-recall state, no `00-handoff.md`,
  no numbered artifacts) before treating a project as new — mitigating 4.7's
  stricter literalism on empty `apex-recall show` responses. Audit table
  archived under `tmp/phase5-opus-audit-table.md`.
- docs: update `agent-authoring.instructions.md` § `model` to document the
  new source-of-truth (frontmatter canonical, registry mirrors, catalog is
  documentation), the array/string/JSON-string frontmatter form mandate, and
  the YAML-bareword forbidden form. Update `[claude-guide]:` reference link
  to the current `platform.claude.com` URL.

- refactor(hooks): consolidate agent hooks — merge `governance-audit/` and
  `session-logger/` into single `session-telemetry/` directory. Adds `tool-audit/`
  (PostToolUse metadata logging), gitleaks pre-commit guard, bats-based hook
  test suite, and CI enforcement. Lefthook pre-commit consolidated (5→2 validator
  commands, parallel enabled) and post-commit removed (checks migrated to pre-push).

- refactor(tools): consolidate tests under `tools/tests/`.
  Moves `tests/` → `tools/tests/`. Updates npm test commands,
  markdownlint excludes, and documentation references.

- refactor(tools): consolidate validation scripts under `tools/scripts/`.
  Moves `scripts/` → `tools/scripts/`. Updates 45+ npm scripts, lefthook
  hooks, CI workflows, instruction applyTo globs, and documentation.

- refactor(tools): consolidate registry files under `tools/registry/`.
  Moves `.github/agent-registry.json` and `.github/count-manifest.json`
  to `tools/registry/`. Updates path references across scripts, agents,
  skills, instructions, prompts, workflows, and documentation.

- refactor(tools): consolidate MCP servers under `tools/mcp-servers/`.
  Moves `mcp/azure-pricing-mcp/` → `tools/mcp-servers/azure-pricing/` and
  `mcp/drawio-mcp-server/` → `tools/mcp-servers/drawio/`. Updates all path
  references across config, devcontainer, agents, docs, and validation.

- feat(cli): `apex-recall` CLI v0.2.0 for progressive cross-project session recall.
  Indexes `agent-output/` into SQLite + FTS5 for low-token context recovery.
  Owns the full session lifecycle (read + write) via CLI commands; replaces the
  deleted `session-resume` skill.

- refactor(tools): consolidate JSON schemas under `tools/schemas/`.
  Moves `schemas/*.schema.json` → `tools/schemas/`. Updates all `$schema`,
  `$id`, path constants, and documentation references.

### Changed

- feat(governance): `schemas/governance-constraints.schema.json` is now
  enforced at validation time. `scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs` compiles the
  schema with AJV (draft 2020-12) and validates every
  `agent-output/*/04-governance-constraints.json` artifact in Step 5b. Drops
  the schema from advisory-only to hard-gate for the JSON companion.
- feat(governance): structured policy-override pattern — `04g-Governance` now
  emits Deny findings with an optional `override` block (`reason`, `issue_link`,
  `expiry`) instead of silently dropping overridden policies. Codegen agents
  (`06b`/`06t`) treat overrides as informational warnings and inject
  `// OVERRIDE <id> until <date> — see <issue>` banner comments above affected
  resources; missing fields or past expiry fail closed. JSON shape captured in
  new `schemas/governance-constraints.schema.json` (`schema_version:
governance-constraints-v1`) for future AJV enforcement.
- fix(agents): normalise `e2e-orchestrator.agent.md` model frontmatter to the
  standard array form `["Claude Opus 4.6"]` (was the only agent using the
  `"Claude Opus 4.6 (copilot)"` string form).
- feat(orchestrator): document the complexity auto-calc procedure in
  `01-orchestrator.agent.md` — formula read from `workflow-graph.json`
  `metadata.complexity_routing`, inputs sourced from architecture + governance
  artefacts, result persisted at `decisions.complexity` so every downstream
  agent reads the same value.
- docs: admonition taxonomy (`note`/`tip`/`caution`/`danger`) and mandatory
  `## Related` footer pattern documented in `docs.instructions.md`; footers
  added to the 6 guide pages that lacked them.
- feat(drawio): 10-point visual-quality rubric (title, footer, legend, grouping,
  spacing, palette, edge labels, canonical icons, anchor stability, cross-cutting
  container) added to `.github/skills/drawio/references/validation-checklist.md`
  with `automated?`/rationale columns. Formalise APEX palette (compute `#E7F5FF`,
  data `#FFF2CC`, security `#FFE6E6`, networking `#E6F5E6`, governance `#F5F5F5`),
  typography (title 14–16pt, service 11pt, footer 9pt), and spacing (40/80/120 px)
  in `style-reference.md`. `scripts/validate-drawio-files.mjs` adds an advisory
  palette-drift check on `03-des-*`, `04-*-diagram`, `07-ab-*`, and `showcase-*`
  files; promote to blocking with `APEX_DRAWIO_RUBRIC=strict` (default advisory
  until 0.12.0).
- perf(mcp): Azure Pricing MCP — raise HTTP pool ceiling 10→20 (per-host 5→10)
  and dedup cache TTL 30s→300s / capacity 100→512 entries, configurable via
  `AZURE_PRICING_HTTP_POOL_SIZE`, `AZURE_PRICING_HTTP_POOL_PER_HOST`,
  `AZURE_PRICING_DEDUP_TTL`, `AZURE_PRICING_DEDUP_MAX_ENTRIES`. Defaults also
  surfaced in `.vscode/mcp.json`. Cuts repeated-query latency on multi-region
  bulk estimates; retail prices refresh at most hourly so 5-min reuse is safe.
- feat(agents): add `.github/model-catalog.json` (single source of allowed Copilot
  models with vendor, tier, release date, and deprecation flag) plus
  `scripts/validate-model-floors.mjs` wired into `validate:_node` and CI. Extend
  `.github/skills/workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json` with a
  deterministic `complexity_routing` formula (resource count, policy violations,
  IaC-tool weight → passes) so orchestrators auto-route challenger passes from
  session state instead of guessing.
- docs: single-source glossary — `docs/GLOSSARY.md` is now a 9-line stub pointing
  to `site/src/content/docs/reference/glossary.md` (removes 570-line duplicate,
  fixes circular `#orchestrator` self-link, moves Orchestrator to its own `## O`
  section). Clarify `VERSION.md` 0.10.0 status as pre-release/Unreleased.
- chore(instructions): narrow overly-broad `applyTo` globs on `no-heredoc`,
  `no-hardcoded-counts`, `markdown`, and `code-quality` to reclaim context budget
  on every agent load. Merge `agent-research-first.instructions.md` into
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md` (single source). Upgrade
  `scripts/validate-glob-audit.mjs` to flag any `applyTo: "**"` plus oversized
  `**/*.md` globs.
- feat(azd): per-project azd multi-project support — `azure.yaml` and `.azure/` now live
  inside `infra/{iac}/{project}/` (co-located with `infra.path: .`), replacing the
  repo-root convention that broke multi-project isolation. Environment naming uses
  `{project}-{env}` (e.g., `hub-spoke-dev`). All `.azure/plan.md` references across
  50+ files updated to project-scoped paths.
- feat(azd): add azd support to the Terraform path — 06t-terraform-codegen now generates
  `azure.yaml` (with `infra.provider: terraform`) and `main.tfvars.json` parameter mapping;
  07t-terraform-deploy gains azd detection with fallback to pure `terraform apply`.
- feat(skills): new `iac-common/references/azd-vs-deploy-guide.md` — consolidated reference
  comparing azd vs deploy.ps1 (comparison table, per-project conventions, workflow, hooks,
  azure.yaml schema, detection logic, troubleshooting). Cross-linked from azure-deploy,
  recipe-selection, and azd-deployment SDK reference.
- feat(docs): new `site/src/content/docs/guides/azd-deployment.mdx` — Astro Starlight docs
  site guide covering azd vs deploy.ps1, per-project layout, workflow, hooks, schema, and
  troubleshooting.
- feat(security): expand IaC security baseline with 6 new rules — `allowSharedKeyAccess`,
  App Service HTTP/2, MySQL SSL, Container Registry admin user (all blocking), plus
  `defaultToOAuthAuthentication` (warning). WAF pillar tagging (SE:05/06/07) and MCSB links
  added to docs site. Updated AGENTS.md security section.
- refactor(scripts): migrate 6 validators to shared Reporter pattern — validate-governance-refs,
  validate-hooks, validate-instruction-checks, validate-drawio-files, validate-excalidraw-files,
  validate-iac-security-baseline. New `_lib/regex-helpers.mjs` (`findAllMatches`) eliminates
  fragile manual `lastIndex` resets. New `_lib/glob-helpers.mjs` (`walkFiles`) provides
  consistent file-walking with symlink detection.
- fix(scripts): remove unnecessary `/g` flag from per-line `.test()` patterns in
  `check-docs-freshness.mjs` (root cause of `lastIndex` fragility).
- refactor(agents): reduce prompt-body duplication by trimming the largest deploy, architect,
  and E2E agents; extract shared deploy, codegen, placeholder-scan, and direct-execution
  protocols into reusable skill references; and raise the advisory large-agent context target
  from 300 to 350 body lines in repo guidance and validators.
- refactor(instructions): replace the monolithic IaC guidance with split Bicep, Terraform,
  and implementation-plan instruction files plus shared policy, security, and cost-monitoring
  references.
- refactor(docs): align repository docs and site docs with `.github/agents`,
  `.github/instructions`, and `.github/skills` as the single source of truth, including
  current subagent names and instruction filenames.
- feat(skills): update the `azure-deploy` skill so a missing `.azure/plan.md` automatically
  triggers the `azure-prepare` then `azure-validate` flow before deployment proceeds.
