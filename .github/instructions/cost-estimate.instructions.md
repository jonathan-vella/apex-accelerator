# Azure Cost Estimate Documentation Standards

Guidelines for creating comprehensive Azure cost estimate documents that include architecture context,
business justification, visual diagrams, and impactful callouts. These documents serve as financial
planning artifacts for Azure infrastructure projects.

## Document Purpose

Cost estimate documents should provide:

- **Financial clarity** for stakeholders and budget approvals
- **Architecture context** linking costs to design decisions
- **Business justification** connecting technical choices to outcomes
- **Optimization guidance** for reducing costs without sacrificing quality
- **Visual impact** through callouts, charts, and progress indicators

---

## Visual Design Standards

### Color Palette (Azure/Microsoft Brand)

Use consistent colors throughout the document:

| Category            | Color  | Hex Code  | Emoji |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------- | ----- |
| Compute             | Blue   | `#0078D4` | 💻    |
| Data Services       | Green  | `#107C10` | 💾    |
| Networking          | Purple | `#5C2D91` | 🌐    |
| Messaging           | Orange | `#D83B01` | 📨    |
| Security/Management | Yellow | `#FFB900` | 🔐    |
| Monitoring          | Teal   | `#008272` | 📊    |

### Status Indicators

Use these indicators for quick visual scanning:

| Status         | Indicator | Usage                            |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Under budget   | ✅        | Budget utilization < 80%         |
| Near budget    | ⚠️        | Budget utilization 80-100%       |
| Over budget    | ❌        | Budget utilization > 100%        |
| Cost increase  | 📈        | Scaling or premium SKU decisions |
| Cost decrease  | 📉        | Optimization opportunities       |
| Stable         | ➡️        | No significant change            |
| Risk/Warning   | ⚠️        | Potential cost overruns          |
| Recommendation | 💡        | Optimization suggestions         |
| Savings        | 💰        | Money saved with commitments     |

---

## Required Sections

### 1. Header Block

Include metadata at the top of every cost estimate:

```markdown
# Azure Cost Estimate: {Project Name}

**Generated**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Region**: {primary-region} ({location-name})
**Environment**: {Production|Staging|Development}
**MCP Tools Used**: {list of azure-pricing/\* tools used}
**Architecture Reference**: {link to WAF assessment or architecture doc}
```

### 2. Cost At-a-Glance (High Impact Section)

Add a prominent callout box immediately after the header:

````markdown
---

## 💰 Cost At-a-Glance

> **Monthly Total: ~$X,XXX** | Annual: ~$XX,XXX
>
> ```
> Budget: ████████░░ 80% utilized ($X,XXX of $X,XXX)
> ```
>
> | Status            | Indicator                        |
> | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
> | Budget Status     | ✅ Under Budget                  |
> | Cost Trend        | ➡️ Stable                        |
> | Savings Available | 💰 $X,XXX/year with reservations |
````

**Progress Bar Examples:**

```markdown
<!-- Under budget (green feel) -->

Budget: ███░░░░░░░ 27% utilized ($207 of $800) ✅

<!-- Near budget (caution) -->

Budget: ████████░░ 80% utilized ($640 of $800) ⚠️

<!-- Over budget (alert) -->

Budget: ██████████ 120% utilized ($960 of $800) ❌
```

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

- Use real-time pricing from Azure Pricing MCP tools
- Show list prices (PAYG) as the baseline
- Include savings plan options for significant resources
- Link costs to architecture decisions
- Provide business context for premium SKU choices
- Use emoji and visual indicators for quick scanning
- Include progress bars for budget utilization
- Highlight top cost drivers prominently
- Flag potential cost risks with warning indicators
- Update estimates when architecture changes

### DON'T ❌

- Include customer-specific discounts (these vary by agreement)
- Use outdated pricing data (re-query before publishing)
- Omit assumptions about usage patterns
- Forget to include all environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Skip the regional comparison for EU/compliance scenarios
- Ignore potential cost risks or overruns
- Use only text - add visual elements for impact

---
